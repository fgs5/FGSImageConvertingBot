# ImageConvertingBot.

## **STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**

Notice that this is a **study** project, so use the provided code as your own homework or 
production at your own risk.

During studying in University I faced a need of converting multiple JPG-files to PDF and 
uploading them in a testing system. So that I decided to automize that task by writing a telegram-bot. 
Current version is capable of receiving files, saving them and converting to a PDF. In upcoming versions
an ability to send files back will also be added.
